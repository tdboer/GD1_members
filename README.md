# GD1_members
This repo contains the best-fit GD-1 member stars from the combined Gaia DR2 + PanSTARRS DR1 dataset. 
The members are selected based on distance, proper motion, colour and magnitude, employing a matched filter selection and new distance determination along the stream.
The work is described in: https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05745
